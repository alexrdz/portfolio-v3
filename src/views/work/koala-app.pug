            p I led the team in a few exercises to determine user flows. We identified key areas where on which to focus and where pain points might arise. Because of the time limit (3 week project) we were limited in our ability to do extensive user research. We conducted a couple of interviews and used those to inform Koala's workflow process. I wireframed the app, used those to quick user testing, and proceeded to design and development.
